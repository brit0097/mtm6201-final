# My Web Portfolio

## About the Project

This is my personal web portfolio where I showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in web development. The portfolio is designed to reflect my passion for creativity, technology, and continuous learning.

## Development Process

### Process
The development process began with outlining the structure and design of the portfolio. I utilized wireframes and mockups to visualize the layout and user experience. The next step was to choose appropriate technologies and frameworks that would help bring the design to life. I started by coding the HTML, then added Bootstrap classes, and finished with custom CSS and adding animated scrolls.

### Challenges
- **Responsive Design:** This was my first project using Bootstrap. Initially, I found it challenging to distinguish between the Bootstrap grid system and CSS Grid/Flexbox. However, with practice, it became more intuitive.
- **Optimizing Images:** Ensuring fast load times without compromising quality was a challenge. I addressed this by using the `<picture>` element with different image sizes and formats.
- **Implementing Hover and Focus Pseudo-classes:** Creating a unique hover effect was challenging. After experimentation, I decided to use border-radius and transitions to achieve the desired look.
- **Implementing Animations:** Adding animations with the AOS (Animate On Scroll) library was initially tricky. I faced issues with specific sections and the footer, which required additional testing and research to resolve.

### Solutions
- **Responsive Design:** Practiced and reviewed Bootstrap documentation to better understand its grid system.
- **Optimizing Images:** Used image compression tools and the `<picture>` element for responsive images.
- **Implementing Hover and Focus Pseudo-classes:** Experimented with different styles and transitions to achieve the desired hover effects.
- **Implementing Animations:** Explored the AOS website and experimented with configurations to achieve the desired animation effects.

## Lessons Learned
- **Importance of Planning:** Thorough planning, wireframing, and organizing coding structure and logic can significantly streamline the development process.
- **Responsive Design Techniques:** Gained a deeper understanding of Bootstrap's grid system and its responsive design capabilities.
- **Performance Optimization:** Learned various techniques to optimize images and improve website performance.
- **Animation Integration:** Improved skills in integrating third-party libraries for enhancing user experience.
